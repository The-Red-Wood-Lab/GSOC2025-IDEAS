# Misinformation Shield: AI Toolkit for Social Media Fact-Checking

## Overview
In current scenario , Hate on Social Media has increased in such a way that it is hard to differentiate between hate , sarcasm and negativity overall. We are trying to differentiate the three cases using NLP , Reinforcement Agent and Attention Models along with Advanced Deep learning techniques such as Bi-directional LSTM which will classify the Content and comments on the posts of social media 

## Key Features
- **Data Acquisition**: Web scraping to collect relevant social media data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Robust cleaning and normalization of textual data.
- **Advanced Classification**: Transformer-based models to accurately differentiate between factual and misleading content.
- **Explainability**: Utilization of explainability techniques (e.g., SHAP values) to provide insights into model decisions.

## Expected Outcomes
- A modular, Python-based toolkit for misinformation detection.
- Pretrained models ready for deployment.
- A comprehensive API and documentation for community engagement and further development.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: Transformers, spaCy, scikit-learn
- **Additional Tools**: Web scraping frameworks(selenium or Beautiful Soap) and API development libraries
- **Web Development Tools** : React.js/Next.js, HTML,CSS ,Javascript 

## Project Details
- **Difficulty**: Medium to Hard
- **Estimated Timeline**: 175 to 350 hours (depending on feature scope and complexity)

# Speaker Diarization with NLP

## Overview
This project is dedicated to creating an intelligent, user-friendly system that can accurately distinguish and separate individual speakers in any audio conversation. By leveraging advanced natural language processing and voice recognition technologies, the system doesn’t just capture speech—it thoughtfully assigns labels to each speaker, ensuring that every voice is clearly identified. In doing so, it transforms raw audio into well-organized, easily navigable dialogue, much like having a skilled moderator at a conversation. Ultimately, our goal is to bring a human touch to automated transcription, making digital interpretations as nuanced and natural as real-life interactions.

## Applications
- Automated transcription services
- Legal documentation and proceedings
- Analysis of conference calls
- Assistive technologies in healthcare

## Technology Stack
- **Tools & Libraries**: PyAnnotate, NVIDIA NeMo
- **Techniques**: Advanced NLP for contextual analysis

## Project Details
- **Difficulty**: Medium to Hard
- **Estimated Timeline**: Approximately 175 hours

## Mentor

# Reinforcement Learning-Based Visual Transformer for Adaptive Patch Sampling

## Overview

Imagine a model that doesn’t just see an image—it understands which parts matter the most. Our project does exactly that by combining a visual transformer with adaptive patch sampling. Instead of processing an entire image uniformly, the transformer smartly selects key patches, capturing essential details with greater efficiency. To take things a step further, we introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) agent that continuously refines the model’s accuracy. By learning from its own experiences and feedback, the RL component helps the system adapt and improve over time, making it even better at deciphering complex visual data.

This innovative blend of adaptive image encoding and dynamic, feedback-driven learning sets the stage for breakthroughs in tasks like image recognition and scene understanding.

## Technology Stack

- **PyTorch**: Our go-to framework for deep learning model development, providing robust tools for building and training the visual transformer.
- **Reinforcement Learning Libraries**: Tools such as [Stable Baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3) or [RLlib](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib.html) to implement and fine-tune our RL agent.
- **Image Processing**: Libraries like OpenCV and PIL for efficient image handling, transformation, and augmentation.
- **Visualization & Monitoring**: TensorBoard and Matplotlib help us track training metrics and visualize model performance in real-time.
- **Experiment Tracking**: Platforms such as Weights & Biases (W&B) or MLflow ensure that every experiment, parameter tweak, and result is logged for continuous improvement.
- **Data Manipulation**: NumPy and Pandas support data preprocessing and management, ensuring smooth integration across the pipeline.

## Project Details
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Estimated Timeline**: Approximately 375 hours
